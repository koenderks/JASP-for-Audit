The use of explanatory text
==========================

The explanatory text provides you with an in-depth explanation of each step in the audit process. The text will help you understand what the practical interpretation of your choices is, and helps translate your statistical findings to others (in common English). With explanatory text enabled, each figure will also have its own caption interpreting the result displayed in that graph.
